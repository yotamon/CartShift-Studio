## The Challenge

Terra Kitchen Group operates 5 Mediterranean restaurants across the greater metro area. Despite excellent food and loyal customers, their digital presence was holding them back:

- **Outdated website** built 6 years ago on a page builder, slow and hard to update
- **No online ordering** during a time when delivery was becoming essential
- **Scattered information** - Each location had different menu versions online
- **Zero local SEO** - Not appearing in Google Maps or local searches
- **Manual reservation system** using phone calls only
- **No mobile optimization** - 60% of visitors on mobile, but site was unusable

The pandemic accelerated their need for digital transformation, and they needed a solution fast.

## Our Approach

We built a comprehensive WordPress solution that could scale with their business while remaining easy to manage.

### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Week 1)

Deep dive into their operations:
- Visited all 5 locations to understand unique offerings
- Interviewed staff about operational challenges
- Analyzed competitor websites and SEO landscape
- Mapped customer journey from Google search to seated table

Key findings:
- 80% of new customers start with "Mediterranean restaurant near me" searches
- Customers wanted to see menus before visiting
- Staff spent 2+ hours daily on phone reservations
- No centralized way to update menus across locations

### Phase 2: Architecture & Development (Week 2-4)

Built a scalable WordPress multisite-like structure:

**Custom Theme Development**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Fast loading with lazy images and optimized code
- Dark, elegant aesthetic matching their brand
- Custom Gutenberg blocks for easy content editing

**Location Management System**
- Each location with unique pages but shared templates
- Location-specific menus, hours, and contact info
- Google Maps integration with custom styling
- Click-to-call for mobile users

**Menu Management**
- Custom post type for menu items
- Category and dietary filter system
- Easy price updates from WordPress admin
- Automatic sync across all location pages

**Reservation System**
- OpenTable widget integration
- Real-time availability display
- Automated confirmation emails
- Admin dashboard for reservation management

### Phase 3: Online Ordering & Delivery (Week 4-5)

Integrated third-party ordering:
- Square Online ordering embedded seamlessly
- Location-based menu routing
- Delivery zone configuration per location
- Order tracking and notifications

### Phase 4: Local SEO & Launch (Week 5)

Comprehensive local optimization:
- Google Business Profile optimization for all 5 locations
- Local schema markup (LocalBusiness, Restaurant, Menu)
- Location-specific landing pages with unique content
- Review generation strategy implementation
- NAP consistency audit across 50+ directories

## The Results

### Online Reservations: +95%
From 240 to 468 monthly reservations. The easy online booking replaced phone calls and captured after-hours bookings.

### New Delivery Revenue: $18K/month
Online ordering launched as new revenue stream, averaging $18K/month within 90 days.

### Page Speed: 63% Faster
From 5.2s to 1.9s, dramatically improving user experience and SEO.

### Local SEO: Top 3 Rankings
All 5 locations now appear in Google's Local Pack for key searches like "Mediterranean restaurant near me."

## Key Features Built

### Easy Menu Management
```
WordPress Admin → Menus
├── Appetizers
│   ├── Hummus Trio ($14)
│   ├── Falafel Plate ($12)
│   └── ...
├── Main Courses
├── Desserts
└── Drinks
```
Staff can update prices, descriptions, and availability in minutes.

### Location Selector
Smart detection suggests nearest location while allowing easy switching:
- Geolocation on first visit
- Cookie-based remembering
- Clear location switcher in header
- Location-specific content throughout

### Performance Optimizations
- WP Rocket caching
- Cloudflare CDN
- WebP image conversion
- Database optimization
- Minimal plugin approach

## Ongoing Partnership

We continue working with Terra Kitchen on:
- Monthly SEO performance monitoring
- Seasonal menu updates
- New feature development (gift cards, catering forms)
- Performance optimization as traffic grows
- Third location launches (2 new locations in pipeline)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Local SEO is foundational** - For location-based businesses, appearing in Google Maps is everything
2. **Simplify operations** - The best sites reduce manual work, not just look pretty
3. **Multi-location needs structure** - Without proper architecture, managing multiple locations becomes chaos
4. **Mobile-first is mandatory** - Restaurant customers are often searching on-the-go
