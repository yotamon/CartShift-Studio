# ✅ Team Invitation System - COMPLETE & WORKING!

## Summary

The team invitation system is now **fully functional** with a manual sharing workflow. Here's what works:

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Invite Creation** - Fully functional
   - Creates invite record in Firestore
   - Validates email isn't already a member
   - Prevents duplicate invites
   - Sets 7-day expiration
   - Assigns role (Admin, Member, Viewer)

2. **Invite Sharing** - Manual (No email required!)
   - Click "Copy Invite Link" button
   - Share link via any channel (Slack, email, etc.)
   - Link format: `https://yoursite.com/portal/invite/INVITE_ID`

3. **Invite Acceptance** - Beautiful flow
   - Recipient clicks link
   - Sees invite details (who invited them, role, expiration)
   - Must sign in with invited email
   - One-click accept
   - Auto-redirects to organization dashboard

4. **Invite Management**
   - View all pending invites
   - Cancel invites
   - See invite status and dates

## How To Use (Step-by-Step)

### Inviting a Team Member:

1. Go to `/portal/org/YOUR-ORG-ID/team`
2. Click "Invite Colleague" button
3. Fill in:
   - Email address
   - Role (Admin/Member/Viewer)
4. Click "Send Invite"
5. **Click "COPY INVITE LINK"** on the pending invite
6. Share the link with your colleague (via Slack, email, text, etc.)

### Accepting an Invite:

1. Recipient clicks the invite link
2. If not logged in: Click "Sign In"
3. Sign in with the invited email address
4. Click "Accept Invite"
5. Done! Redirected to organization

## Firestore Security Rules - CRITICAL!

I've created `firestore.rules` with proper permissions. **You MUST deploy these rules to Firebase:**

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Manual)
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database → Rules
4. Copy the contents of `firestore.rules`
5. Paste and click "Publish"

###Option 2: Firebase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if you haven't
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize (if not already done)
firebase init firestore

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Why No Automatic Emails?

Sending emails requires:
- Email service provider (SendGrid, Resend, AWS SES)
- API keys and configuration
- Server-side function or API route
- Email templates
- Costs money in production

**Current implementation:**
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ No costs
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ Easy to upgrade to automatic emails later

---

## Upgrade to Automatic Emails (When Ready)

### Recommended: Resend (Modern, Free Tier)

1. **Sign up:** https://resend.com
2. **Get API key**
3. **Add to .env:**
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_here
   ```

4. **Create email template:**
   ```typescript
   // lib/emails/team-invite.ts
   export const teamInviteEmail = (inviteLink: string, orgName: string, inviterName: string) => `
     <h1>You've been invited to ${orgName}</h1>
     <p>${inviterName} has invited you to join their team.</p>
     <a href="${inviteLink}">Accept Invitation</a>
   `;
   ```

5. **Update inviteTeamMember function:**
   ```typescript
   // After creating invite in Firestore:
   await fetch('https://api.resend.com/emails', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.RESEND_API_KEY}`,
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       from: 'noreply@yourdomain.com',
       to: email,
       subject: `You've been invited to ${orgName}`,
       html: teamInviteEmail(inviteLink, orgName, inviterName),
     }),
   });
   ```
