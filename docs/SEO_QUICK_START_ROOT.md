## Critical Code Changes Needed

Add an H1 tag to the Hero section (currently missing):

<h1 className="text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl font-bold mb-6">
  Custom Shopify & WordPress Development for Growing Businesses
</h1>
```

### 2. Homepage Metadata Enhancement
**File**: `app/page.tsx`

Add metadata export:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Shopify & WordPress Development Agency | Custom eCommerce Solutions",
  description: "Transform your online store with CartShift Studio. Expert Shopify & WordPress developers delivering custom eCommerce solutions that drive sales. Free consultation available.",
  openGraph: {
    title: "CartShift Studio - Bold eCommerce Solutions",
    description: "Expert Shopify & WordPress development for businesses that want to grow online.",
    images: ["/og-image.jpg"],
  },
};
```

### 3. Add FAQ Schema Component
**Create new file**: `components/sections/FAQ.tsx`

```tsx
import Script from "next/script";

interface FAQItem {
  question: string;
  answer: string;
}

interface FAQProps {
  items: FAQItem[];
  title?: string;
}

export function FAQ({ items, title = "Frequently Asked Questions" }: FAQProps) {
  const faqSchema = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "FAQPage",
    "mainEntity": items.map(item => ({
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": item.question,
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": item.answer
      }
    }))
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Script
        id="faq-schema"
        type="application/ld+json"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(faqSchema) }}
      />
      <section className="py-16 md:py-24">
        <div className="container mx-auto px-4">
          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-12">
            {title}
          </h2>
          <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto space-y-6">
            {items.map((item, index) => (
              <details
                key={index}
                className="group bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 cursor-pointer"
              >
                <summary className="font-semibold text-lg flex justify-between items-center">
                  {item.question}
                  <span className="ml-4 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform">
                    ▼
                  </span>
                </summary>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  {item.answer}
                </p>
              </details>
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
    </>
  );
}
```

### 4. Add Breadcrumb Schema to SEO Library
**File**: `lib/seo.ts`

Already implemented! ✅ The `generateBreadcrumbSchema` function exists.

Just need to use it on pages. Example for Shopify page:

```tsx
import { generateBreadcrumbSchema } from "@/lib/seo";

const breadcrumbSchema = generateBreadcrumbSchema([
  { name: "Home", url: "https://cart-shift.com" },
  { name: "Solutions", url: "https://cart-shift.com/solutions" },
  { name: "Shopify Development", url: "https://cart-shift.com/solutions/shopify" }
]);
```

### 5. Optimize Next.js Image Component
**File**: `next.config.mjs`

Change from `unoptimized: true` to proper optimization:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: "export",
  images: {
    unoptimized: false, // Enable optimization
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920],
    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
  },
  // ... rest of config
};
```

**Note**: If using static export, you may need to keep `unoptimized: true` and handle image optimization at build time.

## Environment Variables to Add

Create `.env.local` file in root:

```bash
# Site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://cart-shift.com

# Google Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Firebase Functions (if using)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_FUNCTION_URL=https://your-function-url
```
